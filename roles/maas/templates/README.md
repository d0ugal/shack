# Automated MAAS Envs

These are simple scripts that I use on a day-to-day basis while working on 
MAAS.

- lxd-maas-test

Creates a container for running the MAAS unit tests

- lxd-maas-git

Creates a container for building and running the MAAS snap based on my local
git checkout

- lxd-maas-virt

Create a container with the latest/edge snap

Finally the common script contains some shared functions and so on.
